# Number sequence (Pascal's Triangle)

This is an example project to create Pascal's Triangle. I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to quickly bootstrap a development environment in which I could start building the triangle.

## Steps taken

1. Init CRA
2. Find out logic behind number sequence
3. Build overall component structure
4. Build rows and node within rows
5. Calculate value of numbers
6. Added styling
7. Added animations
